Analysis of League of Legends Pro Players Tournament Income


Introduction

Just as it did with traditional sports, the collection, analysis, and use of all kinds of data is starting to change the way that competitive games are played and understood. Nowadays, as the E-sports became more and more popular, data analyses on E-sports games are also become much more common. Because of the foundations of multiple commercial E-sport Leagues, data analyses is playing a significant role, just like the role they play in NBA and other sport leagues. In this project, the online game League of Legends (LoL), developed by Riot Games in 2009, will be our case study. The main reason is everyone in our group had played and enjoyed the game and would like to bring a more passionate and informed view to this project than they would with another case study. An important aspect was also Riot Games’ API, which allows the public to easily make queries and pull information from their servers. Another great selling point is the fact that League of Legends is one of the most popular modern day E-sports, meaning its balance updates affect people’s lives on a professional level.

The big question.

Can you make money playing League of Legends and what does it take to become a pro player?

As League of Legends is a popular game, there are already a couple of applications that exist in the data analysis sphere. Websites like League of Graphs and MetaSrc collect basic stats and information from the League of Legends API and use it to construct simple analyses like what the earnings are for pro players. My goal was to gather that information and take a deeper dive into saleires, who are the pro players, where are the pro players and what is the chance of becoming one.

Thats exactly what we will cover in this analysis.


Game Overview for those who need more information about the game and to better understand the terms used in the analysis.

League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battleground Arena (MOBA) style game developed by Riot Games. Each game consists of two teams with 5 players each. Each team starts the game at opposite sides of the arena in a base that contains their Nexus. The goal of each game is to overcome obstacles such as minions, structures and enemy players in order to destroy the enemy Nexus. Each team generally consists of 5 standard positions divided across the map: Top, Middle, Jungle, Attack Damage Carry(ADC)/Marksman and Support. Each player in a match, usually lasting between twenty minutes and an hour, controls a unique champion chosen from a pool of more than a hundred with differing characteristics and abilities. The game boasts 100 million monthly players and a flourishing competitive scene with millions in tournament prize pools as well as online viewers.
